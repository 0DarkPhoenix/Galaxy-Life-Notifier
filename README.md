# Galaxy Life Notifier

The Galaxy Life Notifier is an application made to keep track of cooldown times of items, workers, laboratory times, etc., finally giving players a clear overview of when each task will be finished. And as the name suggests, it will notify you when something is done!

Because everyone has their own preferences, you can change the settings to your liking and even change the color of several elements!
