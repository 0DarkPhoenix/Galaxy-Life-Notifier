# Galaxy Life Notifier

The Galaxy Life Notifier is an application made to keep track of cooldown times of items, workers, laboratory times, etc., finally giving players a clear overview of when each task will be finished. And as the name suggests, it will notify you when something is done!

Because everyone has their own preferences, you can change the settings to your liking and even change the color of several elements!

## Installation

There are two options for installing the Galaxy Life Notifier:

- MSI Installer: The easy way to install the application, which automatically makes a shortcut on the desktop and is easy to uninstall.
- ZIP file: Extract the zip file into a folder. The directory doesn't matter, as long as you don't move the .exe file.

The application only works on Windows I haven't tested it on a Linux distro or Mac OS, and I know that the code for the notifications only works on Windows.
